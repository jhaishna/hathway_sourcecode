# Configuration Entries for Logging Problems with the Billing Programs
#
#
# Use these entries to specify how the billing applications log
# information about their activity.
#
# This configuration file is automatically installed and configured with
# default values during Portal installation. You can edit this file to:
#   -- change the default values of the entries.
#   -- disable an entry by inserting a crosshatch (#) at the start of
#        the line.
#   -- enable a commented entry by removing the crosshatch (#).
# 
# Before you make any changes to this file, save a backup copy.
#
# When editing this file, follow the instructions in each section.
# For more information on the general syntax of configuration entries,
# see "Reference Guide to Portal Configuration Files" in the Portal
# online documentation.

# ptr_virtual_time
# 
# Enables the use of pin_virtual_time to advance Portal time, and 
# specifies the shared file for use by all Portal mangers.
#
# The entry has 2 values
#
# #/Empty     	to disable / enable pin_virtual_time in all pin.conf files
#		default = #	(disable)

#========================================================================
# cm_ptr
# 
# Specifies a pointer to the CM or CMMP. 
#
# Use a separate entry for each CM or CMMP. If testnap can't find the
# first CM or CMMP, it looks for the next in the list.
#
# Each entry includes three values:
# 
#     <protocol> = "ip", for this release
#     <host>     = the name or IP address of the computer running the
#                    CM or CMMP
#     <port>     = the TCP port number of the CM or CMMP on this computer
#
# The port number should match a corresponding cm_ports entry with
# the same port number in the CM or CMMP configuration file. The 
# default, 11960, is a commonly specified port for the CM or CMMP.
#========================================================================
- nap cm_ptr ip bms 21964

- sample_del    logfile sample_del.pinlog
- sample_app    logfile sample_app.pinlog 
- sample_search logfile sample_search.pinlog 
- sample_who    logfile sample_who.pinlog


#========================================================================
# login_type
#
# Specifies whether the login name and password are required.
#
# The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = Only a user ID is required.
#    1 = (Default) Both a name and a password are required.
#
# By default, CMs require a user login and password when requesting an open
# context using PCM_CONTEXT_OPEN. However, you can remove this authentication
# requirement by configuring the CM with a cm_login_module of
# cm_login_null.so
#========================================================================
- nap login_type 1


#========================================================================
# login_name
#
# Specifies the login name to use when testnap connects to the CM. 
#========================================================================

#========================================================================
# login_pw
#
# Specifies the password to use when testnap connects to the CM.

#========================================================================
# userid
#
# Specifies the database number and service type for the Portal
# database. 
#
# The CM uses the database number to identify the Portal database 
# and to connect to the correct Data Manager. For connections that don't
# require a login name and password, the CM also passes the service
# type to the database.
#
# The database number, in the form 0.0.0.N, is the number assigned to 
# your Portal database when you installed the system. The default
# is 0.0.0.1.
#
# The service type is /service/pcm_client and the ID is 1.
# DO NOT change these values.
#========================================================================
- - userid 0.0.0.1 /service/pcm_client 1


#========================================================================
# Deadlock Retry Count
#
# Specified the number of attempts to bill an account again in 
# case of a deadlock error.
#
# This entry is required for SQL Server databases.  For other databases,
# this is an optional parameter.  For better performance this count 
# should be set depending on the volumes of the accounts to be billed.
#
#========================================================================
- pin_bill_accts  deadlock_retry_count  20


#========================================================================
# logfile
#
# Specifies the full path to the log file for the billing application.

- pin_billd logfile /apps/pinpdc1/opt/portal/7.5/var/pin_billd/pin_billd.pinlog


#========================================================================
# config_billing_delay
#
# Specifies a delay for disabling the automatic triggering of billing
#
# If the system is configured to record delayed batch usage events in
# Portal, this entry lets you specify the delay, in days, before the
# billing is run. The value cannot be more days than one accounting cycle.
#
# When the pin_bill_accts application runs as part of the
# daily program pin_bill_day, it waits through the specified  delay to
# pick up accounts for billing. However, if a real-time or batch event
# triggers billing during this delay, cycle fees are charged as if there
# were no delay (without running the complete billing).
#
# By default, this configuration parameter is disabled, so the autobilling
# trigger is enabled. This is a system-wide parameter only.
#
# This entry is the same as one in the CM configuration file
#
# In the enabled entry below, the billing run is not delayed but avoids auto
# triggering of billing
#========================================================================
- pin_bill_accts     config_billing_delay 0:6



#======================================================================
#  Enforce billing.
#
#  To record the billing state correctly if billing delay feature is on.
#======================================================================
- pin_bill_accts enforce_billing  1


#========================================================================
# loglevel
#
# Specifies how much information the billing application logs.
# 
# The value for this entry can be:
#
#    0 = no logging
#    1 = (Default) log error messages only
#    2 = log error messages and warnings
#    3 = log error, warning, and debugging messages
#========================================================================

# merchant
#
# The merchant entry is not supported in this release. DO NOT change 
# this entry.
#========================================================================
- pin_billd merchant XXX


#========================================================================
# minimum
#
# Specifies the minimum balance for retrieving accounts during
# credit-card collection (pin_collect).
#
# Use this entry to set a minimum threshold for the amount due on an
# account when searching for accounts for collection. The pin_collect
# billing application retrieves only those accounts with pending
# receivables greater than the minimum you specify. This improves
# collection performance by filtering out accounts that have either no
# balance due or a very small balance due.
#
# The minimum value is expressed in the account currency. If you do
# business in more than one currency, set the minimum low enough to
# retrieve accounts in any of the currencies. For example, if you have
# accounts in both dollars and yen, setting the minimum at "1.00" flags
# an account with a minimum pending receivable of either one dollar or
# one yen.
#
# This entry does not specify the amount below which you won't charge a
# customer's credit card. You set that amount in a billing policy,
# PCM_OP_BILL_POL_PRE_COLLECT, which lets you specify minimum values for
# each account currency. 
#========================================================================
- pin_billd minimum 2.00


#========================================================================
# Performance Entries
#
# Specify how the billing application processes accounts.
#
#     children   = the number of threads used to process the accounts
#     per_batch  = the number of accounts processed by each child
#     fetch_size = the number of accounts cached in system memory
#                    before processing
#
# You can edit these entries to improve performance of billing
# applications. Different billing applications process accounts
# differently, so you usually need to configure these entries differently
# for each application. To specify an entry for a single billing
# application, replace the generic name "pin_billd" with the specific 
# name of the application. For example, you might have these entries:
#
#    - pin_collect      per_batch    240
#    - pin_bill_accts   per_batch   3000
#
# For a complete explanation of setting these variables for best
# performance, see the online document "Portal Configuration
# and Tuning Guide."
#
# Note: The invoice-generation application doesn't use the pin_billd
#       default values. You must set the values for that application
#       independently. See the guidelines for those entries elsewhere
#       in this configuration file.
#========================================================================
- pin_billd	children	5
- pin_billd	per_batch	1000
- pin_billd	fetch_size	5000


#========================================================================
# set_error_status
#
# This entry is used to set the PIN_BILL_ERROR(4) value to billing status 
# field of billinfo object for the subordordinate accounts and parent accounts 
# if the billing failed for subordinate accounts due to some reason.
# 
# By default, this configuration parameter is disabled, and the billing_status 
# is not updated by pin_bill_accts.
#
# If the value of the entry is 1 , the billing status is updated with 
# PIN_BILL_ERROR value for both both subordinate and parent billinfo objects
#
# If the value is 0 (zero) the billing_status is not updated with the 
# PIN_BILL_ERROR value.
#
#========================================================================
#- pin_bill_accts set_error_status 1


#=====================================================================
# hotlist 
# 
# Use this entry to set the location (path and filename) of the hot 
# list file. 
# 
# A hot list is a file containing an array of poids, which need to be 
# handled by the mta application's working threads first. This 
# allows some threads to begin working on some known large or complex 
# accounts/bills as early as possible. The array of poids might be 
# hard-coded in the host list file, or possibly the file could be 
# generated by some other application. 
# 
# The array of poids must be in flist format. Refer to the example 
# files in the distribution for more information about this file. 
#======================================================================
- pin_mta hotlist hotlist


#========================================================================
# mta_logfile 
# 
# Specifies the full path to the log file used by this MTA application. 
# 
# You can enter any valid path.

# 
# How much information the applications should log. 
# 
# The value for this entry can be: 
#  -- 0: no logging 
#  -- 1: log error messages only 
#  -- 2: log error messages and warnings 
#  -- 3: log error messages, warnings, and debugging messages 
#======================================================================
- pin_mta loglevel 3


#======================================================================
# max_errs 
# 
# Use this entry to set the max errors that can be ignored in the app. 
# This parameter is optional. If left unspecified, max_errs = fetch_size 
#======================================================================
- pin_mta max_errs 5000


#====================================================================== 
# monitor 
# 
# Use this entry to set the path and name of shared memory map file. 
# This binary file stores information about the running mta application. 
# With the help of another application (like pin_mta_monitor), you can 
# view and modify the number of threads that are running in the MTA 
# application without interrupting the application. 
# 
#======================================================================
- pin_mta monitor monitor


#====================================================================== 
# multi_db 
# 
# Enables or disables the multidatabase capability of MTA. 
# 
# If you enable multi_db, MTA uses global searching instead of the 
# normal searching. The value for this entry can be: 
# 
#    0 = (Default) Disable global searching 
#    1 = Enable global searching 
#====================================================================== 
- pin_mta multi_db 0


#======================================================================
# Performance Parameters 
# 
# These parameters govern how the MTA applications pulls data from the 
# database and tranfers it to the application space. They also 
# define how many threads (children) are used to process the data in 
# the application. 
# 
#  -- children:   number of threads used to process the accounts in the 
#                 application 
#  -- per_batch:  number of accounts processed by each child 
#  -- per_step:   number of accounts returned in each database search 
#  -- fetch_size: number of accounts cached in application memory 
#                 before processing starts 
# 
# Not all application use all these performance parameters. For example, 
# pin_inv_accts does not use per_batch. 
# 
# You can edit these entries to improve the performance of MTA 
# applications. You typically need to configure these parameters 
# differently for each application. To specify an entry for 
# a specific MTA application, replace the generic "pin_mta" 
# name with the specific name of the application. In the following 
# example pin_inv_accts will use 50000 for the fetch size whereas other 
# applications using this configuration file will use 30000 for the 
# fetch_size : 
#   - pin_mta          fetch_size  30000 
#   - pin_inv_accts    fetch_size  50000 
# 
# For a complete explanation of setting these variables 
# for best performance, see "Improving System Performance" in 
# the online documentation.

#======================================================================
#unset_error_status
# 
# Specifies whether the billing status of the billinfo object is to be 
# set to PIN_BILL_ERROR in case of billing error. 
# 
# The value for this entry can be: 
# 
#    0 = (Default) Sets the billing status in the billinfo object. 
#    1 = Does not set the billing status in the billinfo object. 
# 
# By default when an error is encountered while billing, the status of
