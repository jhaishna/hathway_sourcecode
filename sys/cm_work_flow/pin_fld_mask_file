# This file controls the masking of arbitrary STR field values in flists returned from the cm
# to client applications.
#
# Enable this server-side masking by uncommenting the line:
# - cm pin_fld_mask_file ${PIN_HOME}/sys/cm/pin_fld_mask_file
# in ${PIN_HOME}/sys/cm/pin.conf
#
# Configure the masking by editing this file.
#
# Only fields of type STR can be masked
#
# Each valid entry is of 1 of 3 types:
# 1.   PIN_FLD_XXX        N            c         # mask with a string of length N composed entirely of the prescribed char c
# 2.   PIN_FLD_XXX       -NL           c         # mask with char c but leave up to N chars unmasked on left
# 3.   PIN_FLD_XXX       -NR           c         # mask with char c but leave up to N chars unmasked on right
# In each case N is an integer >= 0 and c is the masking character (N must not exceed 128 for type 1)
# The first type is useful for masking passwords where we don't want to reveal how many characters make up the password.
# The remaining 2 types are useful for partial masking; note that the integer N indicates how many characters are revealed.
