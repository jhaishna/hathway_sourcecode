#   Rate ....... Tax rate.  Value is in percentage, for ex. 4.0 means 4%.

#                This is similar to a "nexus" for the corresponding

#                possible values could be:

#                  Std   - Standard tax computation. Taxes are computed
#                          based on the 'taxable amount', and then added
#                          to the total.
#                  Tax   - 'Tax on tax' computation. Taxes are computed
#                          based on previous 'taxable amounts' and taxes,

#                  NCS   - Non-comulative standard tax computation. Taxes
#                          are computed based on the 'taxable amount',
#                          but are not added to the total.
#                  NCT   - Non-comulative standard tax computation. Taxes
#                          are computed based on previous 'taxable 
#                          amounts' and taxes, but are not added to the
#                          total.
